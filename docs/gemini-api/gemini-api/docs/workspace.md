# Access Google AI Studio with your Workspace account

* On this page

All [Google Workspace](https://workspace.google.com) users have access to AI
Studio by default. If you're a Workspace user and you want to get started with
AI Studio, check out the
[AI Studio quickstart](/gemini-api/docs/ai-studio-quickstart).

## Troubleshooting

If access to AI Studio is disabled for your Google Workspace account, you might
see an error like the following:

`We are sorry, but you do not have access to Google AI Studio. Please contact
your Organization Administrator for access.`

If you think you should have access to AI Studio, contact your Workspace
administrator.

## Enable AI Studio for Workspace users

**Important:** This section is intended for Google Workspace administrators.

As a Google Workspace administrator, you can control who uses AI Studio:

* AI Studio is turned on by default for all editions.
* You can turn AI Studio off or on for sets of users across or within
  organizational units.
* Google Workspace for Education editions: Users under the age of 18 are
  restricted from using AI Studio with their Google Workspace for
  Education accounts. This is true even when the AI Studio setting is
  on. For details, go to [Control access to Google services by
  age](https://support.google.com/a/answer/10651918).

To enable or disable AI Studio for users in your organization, see
[Turn Google AI Studio on or off for users](https://support.google.com/a/answer/15004095).
