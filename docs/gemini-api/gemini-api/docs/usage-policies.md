This page includes additional usage policies for the Gemini API.

## Abuse monitoring

Google is committed to the responsible development and use of AI. To ensure the
safety and integrity of the Gemini API, we have created these policy guidelines.
By using the Gemini API, you agree to the following guidelines, the [Gemini API
Additional Terms of Service](/gemini-api/terms) and Generative AI [Prohibited
Use Policy](https://policies.google.com/terms/generative-ai/use-policy).

### How We Monitor for Misuse

Google's Trust and Safety Team employs a combination of automated and manual
processes to detect potential misuse of the Gemini API and enforce our policies.

* **Automated Detection:** Automated systems scan API usage for violations of
  our Prohibited Use Policy, such as hate speech, harassment, sexually
  explicit content, and dangerous content.
* **Manual Detection:** If a project consistently exhibits suspicious
  activity, it may be flagged for manual review by authorized Google
  personnel.

### How We Handle Data

To help with abuse monitoring, Google retains the following data for fifty-five
(55) days:

* **Prompts:** The text prompts you submit to the API.
* **Contextual Information:** Any additional context you provide with your
  prompts.
* **Output:** The responses generated by the Gemini API.

### How We Investigate Potential Issues

When prompts or model outputs are flagged by safety filters and abuse detection
systems described above, authorized Google employees may assess the flagged
content, and either confirm or correct the classification or determination based
on predefined guidelines and policies. Data can be accessed for human review
only by authorized Google employees via an internal governance assessment and
review management platform. When data is logged for abuse monitoring, it is used
solely for the purpose of policy enforcement and is not used to train or
fine-tune any AI/ML models.

### Working with You on Policy Compliance

If your use of Gemini doesn't align with our policies, we may take the following
steps:

* **Get in touch:** We may reach out to you through email to understand your
  use case and explore ways to bring your usage into compliance.
* **Temporary usage limits:** We may limit your access to the Gemini API.
* **Temporary suspension:** We may temporarily pause your access to the Gemini
  API.
* **Account closure:** As a last resort, and for serious violations, we may
  permanently close your access to the Gemini API and other Google services.

### Scope

These policy guidelines apply to the use of the Gemini API and AI Studio.

## Inline Preference Voting

In Google AI Studio, you might occasionally see a side-by-side comparison of two
different responses to your prompt. This is part of our Inline Preference Voting
system. You'll be asked to choose which response you prefer. This helps us
understand which model outputs users find most helpful.

### Why are we doing this?

We're constantly working to improve our AI models and services. Your feedback
through Inline Preference Voting helps us provide, improve, and develop Google
products and services and machine learning technologies, including Google's
enterprise features, products and services, consistent with the
[Gemini API Additional Terms of Service](/gemini-api/terms) and
[Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

### What data is included in Feedback?

To make informed decisions about our models, we collect certain data when you
participate in Inline Preference Voting:

* **Prompts and Responses:** We record all prompts and responses, including any
  uploaded content, in the conversation you submitted feedback about. We also
  record the two response options that you selected from. This helps us
  understand the context of your preference.
* **Your Vote:** We record which response you preferred. This is the core of the
  feedback we're collecting.
* **Usage Details:** This includes information about which model generated the
  response and other technical and operational details about your usage of this
  feature.

### Your Privacy

We take your privacy seriously. Google takes steps to protect your privacy as
part of this process. This includes disconnecting this data from your Google
Account, API key, and Cloud project before reviewers see or annotate it. **Do
not submit feedback on conversations that include sensitive, confidential, or
personal information.**

### Opting Out

You'll have the option to skip the Inline Preference Voting when it appears.

Thank you for helping us improve Google AI Studio!
