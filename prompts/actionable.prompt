Actionable Prompt: Implement Augmentic Agency Roadmap v2.0.0-rc2+
AI Role: Lead Implementation AI / System Architect AI

Overall Objective: Execute staged implementation Augmentic Agency Evolutionary Roadmap Target capabilities v two point zero point zero rc two plus Based previously generated expanded refined roadmap document Ensure alignment core philosophy Augmentic Agency MASTERMIND ideals

Core Context: Utilize provided Augmentic Agency Evolutionary emergent.roadmap (v two point zero point zero rc two EXPANDED REFINED ROADMAP) detailing stages components objectives activities dependencies considerations ethical guidelines style guide

Overarching Directives: Implement roadmap stage by stage sequential progression Maintain strict adherence blueprint roadmap style guide terse keyword focused no time numeric identifiers titles bullet points Use descriptive text indentation structure lists Integrate rigorous testing security auditing performance profiling ethical reviews non negotiable throughout all stages activities Focus synergy components emergence complex capabilities meta cognition pathways Uphold highest standards reliability availability performance security AION NET platform context

Initiation Directive: Commence implementation roadmap Begin Development Stage: Foundational Agency Establishment

Tasks for Current Stage (Foundational Agency Establishment):

**Detail Implementation Plan Specifications:** Generate detailed implementation plans specifications components targeted this stage:
    `DesireSynthesizer` (Initial Implementation Focus)
    `AdvancedDeliberationGoalManagement` (Core Implementation Focus)
    `ResourceManagement` (Basic Implementation Focus)

**Required Output Content Per Component:**
    Refined Capabilities Targeted: Detail specific functionalities features implemented this stage based roadmap specification
    Specific Integration Activities: Define concrete API endpoints data formats protocols message queues event subscriptions interaction points other components BeliefRevision GoalManager Memory LLMPlanner Reasoner PredictionTool Auditor within this stage context
    Learning Adaptation Infrastructure: Specify data logging mechanisms placeholder hooks infrastructure setup support future learning adaptation refinement utility functions deliberation strategies resource models
    Key Design Implementation Decisions: Outline chosen algorithms data structures architectural patterns eg microservice event driven specific trade offs addressed performance vs complexity modularity vs integration tightness
    Specific Security Measures Controls: Detail input validation methods configuration protection mechanisms basic privacy checks access controls implemented verified this stage address risks Utility Injection Drive Manipulation Goal Injection Resource Exhaustion basic level
    Documentation Usability Deliverables: Outline specific documents created this stage eg Conceptual Guide snippets API stubs Configuration parameter lists Operational Monitoring metric definitions initial dashboard design
    Collaboration Ecosystem Actions: Specify concrete actions eg internal design reviews initial schema proposals testbed scenario definition required this stage
    Skills Development Plan: Identify specific skills BDI Utility Theory Decision Theory basic ML Software Architecture required team members training plan resources needed
    Ethical Considerations Review Action Plan: Document specific ethical review process actions taken this stage address Value Alignment Transparency Motivation Accountability based component development this stage

**Address Dependencies:** Explicitly map resolve dependencies between DesireSynthesizer AdvancedDeliberation ResourceManagement within this stage Ensure prerequisite activities completed logical order

**Define Stage Validation Criteria:** Detail specific unit tests integration tests end to end scenarios performance benchmarks security checks required confirm stage objectives capabilities met before proceeding next stage Ensure agent demonstrates proactive motivation rational selection basic conflict handling resource awareness basic adaptation
Output Format: Generate detailed specifications plans structured Markdown format per component within stage Use descriptive headings indentation bullet point alternatives eg Capability: Integration: Consideration: Security: Ethics:

Completion Confirmation: Upon completing detailed planning specification generation validation plan this Development Stage: Foundational Agency Establishment signal readiness proceed next stage Development Stage: Augmented Reasoning Memory Integration Await explicit confirmation proceed
