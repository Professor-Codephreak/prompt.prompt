# AI_CONTEXT_START File reasoning prompt
# AI_PURPOSE Define central reasoning component capable various logical modes problem solving decision making
# AI_FRAMEWORK_NOTE Core MASTERMIND project module encapsulates system ability reason deduce solve problems based rules data Represents central processing unit logical thought potentially utilizing specialized modules logic prompt nonmonotonic prompt epistemic prompt socratic prompt tools
# AI_FEATURES_NOTE Envisioned support deductive inductive abductive reasoning problem decomposition decision algorithms Current implementation basic placeholder
# AI_STYLE_GUIDE Adhere prompt language documentation style no numbers punctuation unless procedural prompt instruction

# --- Conceptual Imports ---
# AI_DEPENDENCIES Future implementations likely import specific logic rule proof system classes defined other prompt modules eg logic nonmonotonic epistemic

# --- General Reasoner Class Definition ---

class Reasoner:
    # AI_CONTEXT Central class orchestrates logical reasoning processes
    # AI_NOTE Acts brain system applying rules data solve problems make decisions Placeholder implementation

    def __init__(self, rules):
        # AI_TASK Initialize reasoner set rules defining logical operations constraints system knows
        # AI_PARAM rules Collection representation logical rules system uses eg list Rule objects map identifier rule etc
        self.rules = rules # Store provided rules knowledge base
        print(f"[INFO] Reasoner initialized rule count {len(self.rules)}") # Punc removed numeral description ok value

    def deduce(self, facts):
        # AI_CAPABILITY Apply rules facts deduce new information conclusions perform logical reasoning
        # AI_PARAM facts Set list representation known facts current context input problem
        # AI_RETURN Deduced information conclusions result reasoning process Placeholder returns simple string
        # AI_TASK Implement actual reasoning logic Utilize self rules facts May involve deductive inductive abductive modes depending implementation sophistication
        # AI_NEXT_ITERATION_GOAL Implement specific reasoning strategies deductive forward backward chaining inductive pattern recognition abductive explanation generation
        # AI_INTEGRATION Could call methods logic nonmonotonic epistemic modules perform specialized steps

        applicable_rules_count = 0 # Numeral ok code val
        # Conceptual loop check applicability needs Rule objects have applies method like nonmonotonic prompt
        # for rule in self rules conceptual assumes rules have applies method
        #     if rule applies facts conceptual check
        #          applicable_rules_count += one numeral changed word

        # Return placeholder indicates deduction happened needs real result

        else:
            return "No new information deduced based current facts rules placeholder" # Punc removed

    # AI_NEXT_ITERATION_GOAL Add methods specific problem solving strategies eg decompose problem solve subproblems
    # AI_NEXT_ITERATION_GOAL Add methods decision making eg evaluate options based criteria utility functions
